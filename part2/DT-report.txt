23 / 27 GUESSED CORRECTLY
0.8518518518518519 ACCURACY

compared to .8 accuracy using purely the baseline, the accuracy using the DT model increased a good bit. I believe
since the vast majority of datasets classified as live, the DT wouldn't be able to predict significantly better in
comparison

3. You could prune leaves by finding leaves whose probability of guessing correctly is not high, and remove that section.
this could decrease the accuracy of training since it would lose a leaf in which some of its data pieces may reside in,
but could improve the accuracy of the test sets since the tree wont be overfitted to the training set, therefore being
more generally applicable in various pieces of data.
